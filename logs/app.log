NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of severity, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although NASH is linked to an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis and has now become the leading cause of liver failure-related transplantation, the majority of patients with NASH will ultimately die as a result of complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiometabolic diseases. Importantly, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and tightly interrelated with insulin resistance and T2DM. Thus, targeting these interconnected conditions and taking a holistic attitude to the treatment of metabolic disease could prove to be a very beneficial approach. This Review will explore the latest relevant literature and discuss the ongoing therapeutic options for NAFLD focused on targeting intermediary metabolism, insulin resistance and T2DM to remedy the global health burden of these diseases.', 'authors': 'Ferguson Daniel, Finck Brian N'}, {'pmid': '38965663', 'title': 'The latest reports and treatment methods on polycystic ovary syndrome.', 'abstract': 'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an increasingly recognized endocrine disorder. The pathogenesis is not fully known. Polycystic ovary syndrome is still difficult to diagnose correctly, despite simple diagnostic criteria. The aim of the study is to review the current knowledge about PCOS and treatment options for patients with the disease. To explore this topic, publications were reviewed and conclusions drawn from them. The incidence of hyperandrogenism in a patient with PCOS may be as high as 60-80%. Increased androgen levels affect ovulation and menstruation, and also result in hirsutism and acne. Additionally, patients have problems with proper glucose tolerance (insulin resistance), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. PCOS results in various symptoms in patients. The latest treatment methods were analysed. A standard review of publications in the field of diagnosis and treatment of PCOS, IR and hyperandrogenism was used. Lifestyle, especially diet, deserves special attention due to its ease of use. Sleep quality, physical activity and stress reduction are also important. Diet should be the treatment of first choice. Only if dietary intervention does not bring results, the doctor considers pharmacotherapy. Recently, acupuncture and herbal medicine, vagus nerve stimulation have been used in the treatment of PCOS and regulation of hormone levels. Patients are given supplementation to improve the quality of functioning, but it must be remembered that inappropriate doses or too long use may result in a toxic effect opposite to the therapeutic one. Appropriate diet, physical activity - lifestyle changes are crucial in the treatment of PCOS. Supplementation and pharmaceuticals support treatment. It is mandatory to examine these environmental and lifestyle factors as they not only contribute to the occurrence of the disease but also influence its progression. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex metabolic and hormonal disorder that occurs in women. It manifests itself in menstrual disorders, changes in appearance related to excessive hair growth and acne. PCOS is also associated with the risk of other diseases, glucose tolerance (insulin resistance), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome is still difficult to diagnose correctly, despite simple diagnostic criteria.The symptoms and course of the disease vary, specific to each patient. Patients struggle with PCOS, not being aware that it is a significant medical problem. The patients have always had problems with menstruation, so they think it is normal.The article reviews and describes various treatment methods: Hormone therapy, pharmacological methods, supplementation, non-pharmacological methods such as herbal medicine, acupuncture.', 'authors': 'Stańczak Natalia Anna, Grywalska Ewelina, Dudzińska Ewa'}, {'pmid': '37130947', 'title': 'Metformin: update on mechanisms of action and repurposing potential.', 'abstract': 'Currently, metformin is the first-line medication to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in most guidelines and is used daily by >200 million patients. Surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are complex and are still not fully understood. Early evidence highlighted the liver as the major organ involved in the effect of metformin on reducing blood levels of glucose. However, increasing evidence points towards other sites of action that might also have an important role, including the\xa0gastrointestinal tract,\xa0the gut\xa0microbial communities and the\xa0tissue-resident immune cells. At the molecular level, it seems that the mechanisms of action vary depending on the dose of metformin used and duration of treatment. Initial studies have shown that metformin targets hepatic mitochondria; however, the identification of a novel target at low concentrations of metformin at the lysosome surface might reveal a new mechanism of action. Based on the efficacy and safety records in T2DM, attention has been given to the repurposing of metformin as part of adjunct therapy for the treatment of cancer, age-related diseases, inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of metformin and discuss potential emerging novel therapeutic uses.', 'authors': 'Foretz Marc, Guigas Bruno, Viollet Benoit'}, {'pmid': '36965839', 'title': 'Excess body weight: Novel insights into its roles in obesity comorbidities.', 'abstract': 'Excess body weight is a global health problem due to sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet, affecting 2 billion population worldwide. Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic diseases. Notably, the metabolic risk of obesity largely depends on body weight distribution, of which visceral adipose tissues but not subcutaneous fats are closely associated with obesity comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Latest multi-omics and mechanistical studies reported the crucial involvement of genetic and epigenetic alterations, adipokines dysregulation, immunity changes, imbalance of white and brown adipose tissues, and gut microbial dysbiosis in mediating the pathogenic association between visceral adipose tissues and comorbidities. In this review, we explore the epidemiology of excess body weight and the up-to-date mechanism of how excess body weight and obesity lead to chronic complications. We also examine the utilization of visceral fat measurement as an accurate clinical parameter for risk assessment in healthy individuals and clinical outcome prediction in obese subjects. In addition, current approaches for the prevention and treatment of excess body weight and its related metabolic comorbidities are further discussed.', 'authors': 'Zhang Xiang, Ha Suki, Lau Harry Cheuk-Hay, Yu Jun'}, {'pmid': '37037849', 'title': 'Diabetic vascular diseases: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.', 'abstract': 'Vascular complications of diabetes pose a severe threat to human health. Prevention and treatment protocols based on a single vascular complication are no longer suitable for the long-term management of patients with diabetes. Diabetic panvascular disease (DPD) is a clinical syndrome in which vessels of various sizes, including macrovessels and microvessels in the cardiac, cerebral, renal, ophthalmic, and peripheral systems of patients with diabetes, develop atherosclerosis as a common pathology. Pathological manifestations of DPDs usually manifest macrovascular atherosclerosis, as well as microvascular endothelial function impairment, basement membrane thickening, and microthrombosis. Cardiac, cerebral, and peripheral microangiopathy coexist with microangiopathy, while renal and retinal are predominantly microangiopathic. The following associations exist between DPDs: numerous similar molecular mechanisms, and risk-predictive relationships between diseases. Aggressive glycemic control combined with early comprehensive vascular intervention is the key to prevention and treatment. In addition to the widely recommended metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, for the latest molecular mechanisms, aldose reductase inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonizts, glucokinases agonizts, mitochondrial energy modulators, etc. are under active development. DPDs are proposed for patients to obtain more systematic clinical care requires a comprehensive diabetes care center focusing on panvascular diseases. This would leverage the advantages of a cross-disciplinary approach to achieve better integration of the pathogenesis and therapeutic evidence. Such a strategy would confer more clinical benefits to patients and promote the comprehensive development of DPD as a discipline.', 'authors': 'Li Yiwen, Liu Yanfei, Liu Shiwei, Gao Mengqi, Wang Wenting, Chen Keji, Huang Luqi, Liu Yue'}, {'pmid': '38060198', 'title': 'Updates in Bariatric Surgery.', 'abstract': 'Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity as well as type-2 diabetes mellitus. The field of metabolic and bariatric surgery has seen tremendous growth over the past decade with dramatically reduced risks. This article aims to provide an update on bariatric surgery, highlighting the latest outcomes, improvements, and challenges in the field.

GDM is the leading health disease in pregnant women. It is the most common metabolic disease and it can affect up to 25% of women during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a sensitive period that impacts both pregnant women and their unborn children's long-term health. It is a well-known fact that the leading causes of disease and mortality worldwide are diabetes mellitus and cancer, and specifically, women with diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer (BC). Women who have diabetes are equally vulnerable to reproductive diseases. Reproductive dysfunctions with diabetes are mainly attributed to coexisting polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obesity, and hyperinsulinemia, etc. Moreover, India has long been recognized as the world's diabetic capital, and it is widely acknowledged that particularly pregnant and lactating women are among the most affected by diabetes. In India, one-third (33%) of women with GDM had a history of maternal diabetes. Nevertheless, the latest research suggests that gestational diabetes is also a risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases of the mother and offspring. Therefore, in the 21st century, GDM imposes a major challenge for healthcare professionals. We intend to explore the role of diabetes on female reproductive function throughout various stages of life in the perspective of the changing prognosis, prevalence, and prevention of GDM.", 'authors': 'Choudhury Abbas Alam, Devi Rajeswari V'}, {'pmid': '36868730', 'title': 'Physiology of a Forgotten Electrolyte-Magnesium Disorders.', 'abstract': 'Magnesium (Mg', 'authors': 'Ray Evan, Mohan Krithika, Ahmad Syeda, Wolf Matthias T F'}, {'pmid': '37851036', 'title': 'Diabetic Neuropathies.', 'abstract': 'This article provides an up-to-date review of the diagnosis and management of the most common neuropathies that occur in patients with diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes continues to grow worldwide and, as a result, the burden of diabetic neuropathies is also increasing. Most diabetic neuropathies are caused by hyperglycemic effects on small and large fiber nerves, and glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes reduces neuropathy prevalence. However, among people with type 2 diabetes, additional factors, particularly metabolic syndrome components, play a role and should be addressed. Although length-dependent distal symmetric polyneuropathy is the most common form of neuropathy, autonomic syndromes, particularly cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, are associated with increased mortality, whereas lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy and treatment-induced neuropathy cause substantial morbidity. Recent evidence-based guidelines have updated the recommended treatment options to manage pain associated with distal symmetric polyneuropathy of diabetes. Identifying and appropriately diagnosing the neuropathies of diabetes is key to preventing progression. Until better disease-modifying therapies are identified, management remains focused on diabetes and metabolic risk factor control and pain management.', 'authors': 'Elafros Melissa A, Callaghan Brian C'}, {'pmid': '32982969', 'title': 'Diabetes and Sarcopenic Obesity: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatments.', 'abstract': 'Sarcopenic obesity and diabetes are two increasing health problems worldwide, which both share many common risk factors, such as aging, and general obesity. The pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity includes aging, physical inactivity, malnutrition, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, and hormonal changes. Nevertheless, there are two major reasons to cause diabetes: impaired insulin secretion and impaired insulin action. Furthermore, the individual diagnosis of obesity and sarcopenia should be combined to adequately define sarcopenic obesity. Also, the diagnosis of diabetes includes fasting plasma glucose test (FPG), 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), glycated hemoglobin (A1C), and random plasma glucose coupled with symptoms. Healthy diet and physical activity are beneficial to both sarcopenic obesity and diabetes, but there are only recommended drugs for diabetes.
